# IntraStateSpending
Executive Dashboard of Indiana Procurement Card spending - 2015

The State of Indiana is openning access to its spending history data. With this new visibility and transparency we can gain insight 
into the buying behavior of State employees and agencies. We now have a new tool to help with governence and accountability.
This project uses open source D3js, Canvas, blackHole, MongoDB as well as leverages existing visualation projects; clearspending, luckylunch and Hygieia.

With your help we can build a framework to create and share new Dashboards which brings public Data to life. Empowering better decision making, leading to better outcomes.
